### ***About the project***
#### After a long journey in terms of knowledge and not in time, we have gained the experience and knowledge necessary to develop the first full stack application, which will be a food delivery application in which we will use node.js, express, mongooDB, ejs, and we used the necessary skills to develop it.


### ***Technologies***
***Backend Development:***
- ***Node.js:*** A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows for asynchronous event-driven programming and is perfect for building scalable network applications.
- ***Express.js:*** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, perfect for building robust APIs and web applications.
- ***MongoDB:*** A NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model. It's known for its flexibility and scalability, making it ideal for handling large volumes of data.

***Project Management and Collaboration:***
- ***Trello:*** A web-based Kanban-style list-making application, perfect for project management and task organization.
- ***Slack:*** A collaboration hub that brings the right people, information, and tools together to get work done. It offers channels for group discussions, private messaging, and integration with various services.

***Diagramming and Visualization:***
- ***draw.io:*** An online diagramming tool that used to create ER Diagram, and WireFrame. It's versatile and user-friendly, making it ideal for visualizing system architecture and workflows.

***Deployment and Hosting:***
- ***Fly.io:*** A platform for deploying and running applications globally. It offers a global network of secure, low-latency tunnels that connect applications to users.
